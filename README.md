# Host a Dynamic Ecommerce Website on AWS with Terraform

## Overview
This repository holds the Terraform configuration files used to provision a dynamic and resilient Ecommerce website on AWS. The architecture is designed for high availability across multiple Availability Zones in the AWS cloud, employing a range of services for optimal security, performance, and scalability.

## Architecture
The deployed infrastructure includes:

- **VPC** with segregated public and private subnets across two Availability Zones for fault tolerance and traffic segregation.
- **NAT Gateways** to enable outbound internet access for instances in the private subnets.
- **Security Groups** to strictly manage ingress and egress traffic according to the principle of least privilege.
- **RDS MySQL Database** instances with a master in one AZ and a standby replica in another for database high availability.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute web traffic across an auto-scaled fleet of EC2 instances.
- **Auto Scaling Group** to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances, accommodating the load requirements.
- **SNS Topics** for notifications and alerts.
- **Route 53** for DNS management and routing.

## Terraform Files Structure
The Terraform configuration is organized as follows:
```
/
|-- main.tf            # Main configuration file for the Terraform setup
|-- variables.tf       # Variable declarations used in the configurations
|-- outputs.tf         # Output values after the Terraform execution
|-- ...
```

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
- An AWS account with sufficient privileges to create the required resources.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
2. **Plan the Terraform Deployment**:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
3. **Apply the Terraform Configuration**:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

After applying the Terraform configuration, your infrastructure will be set up in AWS, and the Ecommerce website will be accessible.

## Security Best Practices
This setup follows AWS security best practices, including:
- Strictly managed AWS IAM roles and policies.
- Security Groups with minimum necessary access.
- Encrypted data storage and transfer.

## Monitoring and Logging
- AWS CloudWatch has been configured to monitor the health and performance of the services.
- AWS CloudTrail is enabled to log and retain account activity related to actions across the AWS infrastructure.
